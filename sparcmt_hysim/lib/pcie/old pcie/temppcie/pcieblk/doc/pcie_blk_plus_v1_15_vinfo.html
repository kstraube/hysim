2. NEW FEATURES

- ISE 13.2 software support
- Dual Core feature support removed

3. SUPPORTED DEVICES

The following device families are supported by the core for this release.

Virtex-5 XC LXT/SXT/TXT/FXT
Virtex-5 XQ LXT/SXT/FXT                                                


4. RESOLVED ISSUES

   - Support for Dual Core example design
     o CR 540444

     Support for Dual Core Example Design has been removed on the FX70T device.

   - Incoming Memory Reads Re-ordered
     o CR 582981

     Issue resolved where Memory Reads in the Endpoint Receive direction
     were re-ordered, when trn_rnp_ok_n is also deasserted.

   - Transmit TLPs allowed into Buffer before it is empty.
     o CR 583039

     Issue resolved where the Core, in the Transmit direction) accepted TLPs
     on the Transaction Interface buffer, before the Buffer is completely empty.

   - Packets with same ACK/NAK sequence number get lost
     o CR 539017

     Issue resolved where an 8b/10b error on the link causes the incoming packet
     to get lost.

   - Finite Completions setting in GUI working
     o CR 588027

     Issue resolved where the Finite Completions setting in the GUI was not 
     getting translated onto the design itself

   - UpConfigure Fix
     o CR 592181

     Issue resolved where the Upconfigure Fix was causing the Lane to hold an
     incorrect value when the lanes are unaligned.


5. KNOWN ISSUES

The following are known issues for v1.15 of this core at time of release:

    5.1  Functional Issues

    5.2  Simulation Issues

          - Large Simulation Times
          o CR 448685

            Simulation takes a long time to achieve trn_lnk_up_n assertion.
	    This is because GTP model drives the serial lines to Unknown logic
	    state, when signaling Electrical Idle during the link training 
	    phase. Refer to Xilinx Answer 29294 for a work around to this issue.

    5.3  Implementation Issues


          - Speed file and design changes

            The design files present in this release are based on timing 
	    parameters from, and intended for use with, the speed files shipped 
	    with ISE 11.3. As more device characterization data is collected,
	    Xilinx may update the speed files to more closely model device 
	    operation.

            Xilinx reserves the right to modify the design files, including the 
	    core pin-out, in order to maintain full compliance after speed files
	    updates occur. To the full extent possible, Xilinx will incorporate 
	    such modifications without using pin-out changes in an effort to 
	    provide "transparent" design file updates.

           - Timing Closure

            In order to obtain timing closure, designers may be required to use
            multiple PAR seeds and/or floorplanning. Using Multi-Pass Place and
            Route (MPPR), designers can try multiple cost tables in order to meet
            timing. Please see the Development System Reference Guide in the
            Software Manuals found at: <A HREF="http://www.xilinx.com/support/library.htm">www.xilinx.com/support/library.htm</A>
	    for more information on using MPPR. Designers may also have to 
	    floorplan and add advanced placement constraints for both their 
	    design and the core to meet timing.

            - Xilinx warnings

            The Xilinx tools may issue various warnings, however no errors should
            occur.
